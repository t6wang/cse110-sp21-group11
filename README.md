# He11's Kitchen - Recipe Web App 

[Team Page](admin/team.md)

We are creating a recipe app that aims to provide not only various types of recipes of different cuisines, but also provide cooking techniques and how-tos. One of our top priorities is to make it as accessible as possible to accomodate all kinds of users and make their cooking experience swift and enjoyable whether they are coming in with no cooking knowledge or if they are home cooks. Many recipe websites include ad revenues that reload the page and have formats that make it difficult for users to find their spot again. We aim to:

- Categorize our recipes by cuisine and by breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack, dessert, etc
- Provide transcriptions, captions, basic voice-overs, and text versions that should be equally informative for any cool videos and animations
- For photos, fill out alt-text metadata and caption them with actual informative descriptions
- Be mindful of differing measuring systems and equipment and substitutions in recipes
- Provide multiple sensory persceptives and cues in our recipes
- Make it easy to find where the user was
